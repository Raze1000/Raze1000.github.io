											<h2>About Me</h2>

										<p>My full name is Rory Kinlay Clark, I'm 20 years old and I was born and raised in Scotland. I lived in Glasgow for 10 years
										until my parents decided to move to Australia. Currently studying Applied Science - Psychology bachelors degree at RMIT 
										and am looking to push into honors and perhaps masters.</p>

									<h2>IT Interests</h2>

								<ul class="features">
									<li>
										<img src="images/university-solid.svg" alt="" /></span>
										<h2>Why RMIT?</h2>
										<p>Mainly vecause I liked the campus and its facilities. I also like how close it was to Melbourne Central and other indie shops.</p>
									</li>

										<h2>Learning Expectations?</h2>
										<p>Im currently studying psychology so I am wanting to learn how to help people and decifer everyday human behaviour. As for IT though, 
										i would like to learn a bit about how IT systems are connected, maintained and secured as well as improve my coding knowledge.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<img src="images/robot-solid.svg" alt="" /></span>
										<h2>Personal Interests</h2> <br />
									
										<p>My interest in IT stems mainly from programming in the form of AI and automation. For example, coding machines to complete heavy labour tasks and AI as i am curious how far humanity can improve upon it. 
											This interest began when I saw a video of an AI completing mario with perfect percision and speed.
											It amazed me so I looked up similar projects and then discovered other automated robots and programs. Years later I made a small block breaker game and added a piece of code for the pad to track the
											ball and thus complete every level without losing a life as the speed increased. It resparked my interest as I watched it for a while.</p>

									<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
									<p>
									My ideal job would revolve around a small team enviroment with a focused goal but minial supervision,
										leaving room for my own creativity in solving problems and implementing solutions. <br>

									<h3>The Appeal</h3>
									<p>
										The job is placed for a new games studio who have yet to release their first game but cureently have one under works.
										To raise revenue they are designing systems for mining companies so the position is to aid in the odd jobs
										then assist in creating games. What makes this position particularly appealing to me is the size of the studio and 
										room for freedom. A small team means plenty of shared ideas and discussions about the direction of the game which 
										is a aspect of a company that I hope to have when I find a job.
									</p>
								
									<h3>The Qualifications</h3>
									<p>
										This job requires a fully qualified programmer who knows there way around game making software such as Unity. They also require
										knowledge in javascript and HMTL and Github operations. This is understandable due to the size of the company
										as to be a valuable member one must know how all aspects operate. There is simply too little employees
										for each person to have a specilized task. Furthermore, they are looking for someone who can make desicions and implement them.
										Therefore, high level of experience is needed and no trainning will be offered.
									</p>

									<h3>My Current Qualifications</h3> 
									<p>
										I currently have very little experience in terms of coding and desicion making in a project. I have attempted to
										construct games myself and have left them behind due to lack of direction and planning. Thus, improvising for this company
										will be time consuming and is something I will need to work on. I will also need to broaded my skills in other languages 
										and IDE's as I only know Unitys features a little C# coding knowledge.
									</p>
									
									<h3>My Plan</h3>
									<p>
										As of right now, my plan to gain these qualifications is to continue to experiment with Unity and its tools. My programming
										languages have similar syntax and functions. Thus, if I continue to practise with C# and finish my own projects, my current understanding
										will only grow. As for experience, I will try to get hired in an entry level position or voulenteer in an IT enviroment. However, I would rather work on my own projects
										and present them as my experience.

									<p>The results of these tests reveal that I am capable of working with others on projects. In addition,
										listening and comprehending absract ideas from others is one of my strong points. However, I 
										am not afraid to question the status quo or distribution of power which may become a problem 
										if handed a task I do not feel confident in doing. Although, I believe the tests are just guidelines
										and in general I will work well in group.
