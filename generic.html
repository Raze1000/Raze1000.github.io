								<h2>Overview</h2>
								<p>An interesting IT topic I would like to attempt would be an AI program. The example thaty sparked my interest was the team that created a
								mario bros AI that was able to complete the game in the fastest time possible and with complete precision.The AI was given specific parameters to operate on
								and enough processing power to rapidly move between generations until one was successful. If my group were to make something like this
								we would most likely either create or find a simpler game with less mechanics so the AI can learn with less processing power / time
								involved.</p>
								
								<h2>Motivation</h2>
								<p>The reason why I believe this project could be useful is due to the amount of programming a typical coder needs to complete.
								Systems such as Commonwealth banking require my hours and people to design and create an effective system. In addition, maintence
								and updates pose great financal and time loss. A solution would be to develope an advanced AI program to manage and create large
								systems such as this excluding human error. However, this technology is decades away but it must begin somewhere.</p>
								
								<h2>Description</h2>
								<p>This project will hopefully produce an AI program that can learn and navigate through certain tasks presented to it. Intially,
									it will be streamlined programs created by our group that the AI will need to attept and complete. It will mainly take the form
									of trial and error solutions until happening upon the correct one and perfecting it through continued practise. These tasks will most likely
									take the form of mathematical senarios that will have real life implications. For example, the AI will teach itself the quickest route from A to B
									or the most efficient way of organising / stacking a set of shapes. Furthermore, the intent of this AI is not only to emulated human
									intelligence like a chatterbot, but to actually learn from previous successes and failures to develop its own unique set of rules and
									processes.</p>
								
								<h2>Tool and Technologies</h2>
								<p>The software used will be a programming language and a computer that can be left on for long periods of time. This is to ensure that
									the program has ample time to learn uninterrupted and with minimal human interaction. The software will most likely be visual studio or
								eclipse due to popularity, ease of use and they are free.</p>
									
								<h2>Skills Required</h2>
									<p>There will be a large amount of experience needed to complete this project. No software will need to be written but coding within downloaded
										software will need to be known. For our level of experise, this projected has limited feasability for complex tasks but I elieve that if
										the group learns together and tasks are deligated properly a simple AI could be created.</p>
								
								<h2>Outcome</h2>
								<p>If the project is successful, the program created will have the ability to learn and complete tasks faster than a human would
									be able too and with greater accuracy. The program could then be generalised to other tendious human tasks that require too 
									much coding to be completed and could instead be learnt by the AI.
